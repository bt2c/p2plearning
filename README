The brief for this app came from a recent hackerthon:

Easy A were sharing a distributed ledger with coin that could be used for many purposes including our propostion which was a website and app dedicated to learners.

New to the space we decided to submit a non technical proposal:

**For non-technical submissions:**

1. 2-5 page document describing your project (Describe your project as fully as possible! What it does, what problems it solves, how you used Tezos to achieve it etc. This should be scientific and well-laid out, including full references, just like how it all started! See [https://wiki.tezosagora.org/whitepaper](https://wiki.tezosagora.org/whitepaper) and [https://tezos.com/whitepaper.pdf](https://tezos.com/whitepaper.pdf)
2. Short description of your project (<300-char)
3. Technical explanation (what tech did you use to build this project? In particular, what aspects of Tezos did you use? Which features of Tezos made this project uniquely possible?)
4. Link to Google slides ([use template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19-Oz8CUv-9Z1qlFz3XpAC14fzloU-xIAaEpeXIKU0zw/edit#slide=id.g163b5fa709e_0_0))
5. Informal video recording of your presentation (3-5 mins)
